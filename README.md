# AoC_2018
Solutions to https://adventofcode.com for 2018.

My goal for this year is to get everything done using 25 separate languages.  Hopefully I can do this. For some of the languages I do not know as well, due to time constraints beacuse of school, I will be looking at solutions from others and implmenting parts of their solutions into mine.

I will be tracking my progress using Trello at this link: https://trello.com/b/IXLeUSoT/advent-of-code

(Will be taking a break to finish up most of my work for finals because college is hard :X, will still come back and finish all 25)
