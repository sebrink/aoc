# AoC_2018
Solutions to https://adventofcode.com for 2018.

My goal for this year is to get everything done using 25 separate languages.  Hopefully I can do this. For some of the languages I do not know as well, due to time constraints beacuse of school, I will be looking at solutions from others and implmenting parts of their solutions into mine.

I will be tracking my progress using Trello at this link: https://trello.com/b/IXLeUSoT/advent-of-code

8 **Edit:** I have stopped doing this, as there was too much going in my life to dedicate the proper amount of time to this.  From my experience, it would be better to do one or two languages that you are not too familiar with rather than trying to do 25 languages. While in theory it may be cool to finish AOC in 25 different languages, it will not provide the same benefit as doing it in one or two languages.

### Languages
Day 1: Python3.7\
Day 2: Nim\
Day 3: Go\
Day 4: Powershell\
Day 5: Bash (no awk,grep,sed)
